How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functionally secure I can leverage creating thinking and comprehensive testing techniques to check that all code meets user requirements and functions as expected. Creativity and out of the box thinking is useful when considering edge cases and user behavior.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs is an essential part of meeting user expectations. It is important to consider the functionality and requirements of the user before writing code, while writing code, and while writing and developing tests. To do this, it is important to carefully document user requirements as explicitly as possible. When interpreting requirements they could be contextualized with respect to the program functions.
Analyzing user needs logically and exploring how they can be turned into features is key here. 

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software holistically and with a requirements focused mindset. I carefully consider the user requirements and how I can build features and write tests that ensure those requirements are met.
